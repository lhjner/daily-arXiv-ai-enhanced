Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "TMK\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece31.5%\u523097.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u98de\u8dc3", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982CoT\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684Task-Method-Knowledge\uff08TMK\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u8bba\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\uff0cTMK\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece31.5%\u63d0\u5347\u81f397.3%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "TMK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd"}}

Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy.

This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \\emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \\textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\\% fewer verifier calls.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8c03\u7528\u88ab\u6d6a\u8d39\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u65e0\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0a", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0a\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\uff1b(2) \u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9884\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8c03\u7528\u5206\u914d", "result": "\u5728MATH\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4best-of-N\u3001\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8644%\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8c03\u7528", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u5230\u6700\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf"}}

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cCoT\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u770b\u4f3c\"\u514d\u8d39\u8d60\u54c1\"\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5176\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RLVR\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u770b\u4f3c\"\u514d\u8d39\u8d60\u54c1\"\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff08\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u5ea6", "result": "\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u5f3a", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86RLVR\u4e0b\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f1a\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61"}}

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5728\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ec4\u7406\u60f3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff08\u67d0\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff08\u7279\u5b9a\u516c\u7406\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u5bf9\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u6b64\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.\n  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Interfaze\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5e94\u7528\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784DNN\u5806\u6808\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6808\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u5e94\u7528\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002Interfaze\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a(1) \u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5f02\u6784DNN\u914d\u5408\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742PDF\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u7b49\uff1b(2) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\uff1a\u722c\u53d6\u3001\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001PDF\uff09\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff1b(3) \u884c\u52a8\u5c42\uff1a\u652f\u6301\u6d4f\u89c8\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6c99\u7bb1\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u3001\u65e0\u5934\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u3002\u9876\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f6c\u53d1\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "Interfaze-Beta\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1aMMLU-Pro 83.6%\u3001MMLU 91.4%\u3001GPQA-Diamond 81.3%\u3001LiveCodeBench v5 57.8%\u3001AIME-2025 90.0%\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff1aMMMU(val) 77.3%\u3001AI2D 91.5%\u3001ChartQA 90.9%\u3001Common Voice v16 90.8%\u3002\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u7531\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6808\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5927\u578bLLM\u4ec5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "conclusion": "Interfaze\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6808\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision.

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy.

Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u914d\u7f6eAI\u7ba1\u9053\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u534f\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0CPS\u4e2dAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u96c6\u6210", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1aCPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u529f\u80fd\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6848\u8026\u5408\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u914d\u7f6eAI\u7ba1\u9053\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8d1f\u8d23\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u89e3\u8026", "result": "\u5728\u5fae\u5de5\u5382\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1ML\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3aCPS\u4e2dAI\u7ba1\u9053\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218"}}

Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision.

Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario.

Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVibe AIGC\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u610f\u56fe-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5c42\"\u6c1b\u56f4\"\u7684\u6307\u6325\u5b98\uff0c\u7531\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\"\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5929\u82b1\u677f\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u53d7Vibe Coding\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5c42\"\u6c1b\u56f4\"\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5ba1\u7f8e\u504f\u597d\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\uff0c\u5c06\"\u6c1b\u56f4\"\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0cVibe AIGC\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5c06AI\u4ece\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5c06\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u4f7f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u521b\u4f5c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faWideSeek-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e671B\u53c2\u6570\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u74f6\u9888\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWideSeek-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eabLLM\u4f46\u9694\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u57282\u4e07\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "WideSeek-R1-4B\u5728WideSearch\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523040.0%\u7684\u9879\u76eeF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53DeepSeek-R1-671B\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff0cWideSeek-R1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e03\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57dfLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679049\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u6982\u8ff0\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e03\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6846\u67b6\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b29\u4e2a\u5b50\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u660e\u786e\u7eb3\u5165\u6392\u9664\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u5bf949\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5e38\u89c1\uff0876%\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7f55\u89c1\uff0892%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6781\u5c11\uff0898%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff1b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0882%\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u800c\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u884c\u52a8\u5bfc\u5411\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0859%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u7597LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u65b9\u5411"}}

A Competing Hypothesis", "comment": null, "summary": "Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement.

We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEA\uff08\u7fa4\u4f53\u6f14\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u6f14\u5316\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u91c7\u7528\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u652f\u5b64\u7acb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u957f\u671f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u6f14\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08GEA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u6f14\u5316\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5b64\u7acb\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u652f\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SWE-bench Verified\uff1a71.0% vs. 56.7%\uff1bPolyglot\uff1a88.3% vs. 68.3%\uff09\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u9876\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002GEA\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u957f\u671f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u5355\u5143\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.
