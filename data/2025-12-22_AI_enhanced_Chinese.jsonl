Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u68c0\u67e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6UniRel-R1\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8fd4\u56de\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u56fe\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd4\u56de\u5355\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8865\u5145\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3KGQA\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRel-R1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9f13\u52b1\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5ea6\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRel-R1\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4Vanilla\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "UniRel-R1\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3aKGQA\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level.

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles.

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728AppWorld\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SAGE\uff08Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09Sequential Rollout - \u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u94fe\u4e0a\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b2\uff09\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u79ef\u7d2f - \u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09Skill-integrated Reward - \u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728AppWorld\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSAGE\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.9%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c1126%\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u751f\u621059%\u66f4\u5c11\u7684token\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process.

However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models.

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventGPT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u961f\u53cb\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6301\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6301\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d5b\u5b63\u7684\u82f1\u8d85\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528", "conclusion": "EventGPT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7403\u961f\u6216\u6218\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4f9d\u636e"}}

Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u6982\u5ff5\"\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51a5\u738b\u661f\u4e0d\u518d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u4fee\u8ba2\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76AI\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u7f3a\u5931\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\uff09\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ade\u4e89\u89e3\u91ca\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6982\u5ff5\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6982\u5ff5\u8131\u79bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f14\u5316\uff08\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76AI\u81ea\u4e3b\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6bd4\u7279\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Rashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8f6c\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u800c\u975e\u5355\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b2\uff09\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bb8\u53ef\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u3002\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002Rashomon\u96c6\u5408\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GPT-4o\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c100%\u7684Top-3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cbb\u7597\u5ef6\u8bef\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570AI\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u6574\u5408GPT-4o\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u95ee\u4f18\u5148\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001SVM\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001KNN\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u523090%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c100%\u7684Top-3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6539\u5584\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories.

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7eb3\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8868\u683cQ\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c06TRM\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528TRM\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3TRM\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cTRM\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u884c\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u5230\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\"\u4e00\u5200\u5207\"\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u60c5\u611f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u65b9\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u56fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=3,500\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d610\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6760\u6746\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u65f6\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u653f\u7b56\u5e38\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u611f\u77e5\u6216\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\u3002\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u8c03\u8282\u4e86\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u53cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u666e\u904d\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6587\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\"\u4e00\u5200\u5207\"\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
