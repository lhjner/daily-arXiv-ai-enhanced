Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities.

Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent.

This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level.

The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards.

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u56fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684AI\u6cbb\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\uff1a\u867d\u7136AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u60c5\u611f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u6c60\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u65b9\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5168\u7403AI\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u56fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=3500\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u62df\u4eba\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65f6\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\u7b49\u4e92\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u653f\u7b56\u5e38\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u610f\u8bc6\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\uff1b2\uff09\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u786e\u5b9e\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff1b3\uff09\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53d7\u5230\u6587\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u2014\u2014\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08\u5982\u5df4\u897f\uff09\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08\u5982\u65e5\u672c\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u53cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u5168\u7403\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684AI\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8003\u8651\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u591a\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
