Submitted to [RAAI]", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GYWI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u7075\u611f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6210\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u7075\u611f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4f5c\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7075\u611f\u6e90\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff08RAG+GraphRAG\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Prompt\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728arXiv\uff082018-2023\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGYWI\u5728GPT-4o\u3001DeepSeek-V3\u3001Qwen3-8B\u548cGemini 2.5\u7b49\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "GYWI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7075\u611f\u8ffd\u6eaf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Stern"], "title": "Exploring Human Behavior During Abstract Rule Inference and Problem Solving with the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging.

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u89c2\u5bdf\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2\uff09\u68c0\u9a8c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u6790\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u672a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08CWM\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u533a\u5206\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u4f46SFT\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08CWM\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528InfoNCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6316\u6398\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63a8\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdc\u79bb\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScienceWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a1\uff09\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCWM\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u7f16\u8f91\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684Precision@1\u6bd4SFT\u63d0\u9ad86.76\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0cAUC-ROC\u66f4\u9ad8\uff080.929 vs 0.906\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u538b\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cCWM\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff08-2.39 vs -3.96\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6355\u6349\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9AI\u4e0e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u6280\u672f\u5728LCA\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0eLLM\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8be5\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0AI-LCA\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524d\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u65b0\u5174\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u968f\u7740LCA\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0cAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6025\u5267\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u8f6c\u5411LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\uff0cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94LCA\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728AI\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684LCA\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e2e\u52a9LCA\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5c06\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u89c1\u89e3\u878d\u5165\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u89c4\u8303\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u8d85\u51fa\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u677f\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u677f\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8c03\u7814\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6216AI\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u884d\u751f\u51fa\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u677f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548cAI\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u677f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u677f\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548cAI\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u677f\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u51fa\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u80fd\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8702\u7a9dO-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709O-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u591a\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u610f\u56fe\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u68c0\u7d22\u7ecf\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff1bO-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528DRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u4e00LLM\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1141.93%\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u90e8\u7f72\u5355\u72ecLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1192%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406O-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CourtGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CourtGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u7528\u653f\u7b56\u9075\u5faa\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff08\u5728\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7834\u574f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e869\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u89e3\u8026\u4e3aAI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings.

Edward Suh"], "title": "SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management for Long-Horizon Agentic Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "SideQuest\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fdb\u884cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u65f6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528", "motivation": "\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u6587\u6863\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u88ab\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u7684token\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSideQuest\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\u6765\u6267\u884cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u538b\u7f29\u7ba1\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6c61\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528215\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0cSideQuest\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06\u5cf0\u503ctoken\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe65%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SideQuest\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7ba1\u7406\u5176KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "AHBid\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6e20\u9053\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u81ea\u52a8\u51fa\u4ef7\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5e7f\u544a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6e20\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6e20\u9053\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAHBid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9ad8\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408\u6307\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u5e95\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAHBid\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8613.57%\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AHBid\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6e20\u9053\u5e7f\u544a\u81ea\u52a8\u51fa\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3002"}}

As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution.

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLHFless\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u7684\u540c\u6b65RLHF\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u914d\u3001\u524d\u7f00\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.35\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c44.8%\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u6216\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5185\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u9020\u6210\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u589e\u52a0\uff0cRLHF\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u6b65RLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u9002\u5e94RLHF\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff1b3. \u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b4. \u91c7\u7528\u8003\u8651\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5actor\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff1b5. \u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRLHFless\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad81.35\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c44.8%\u7684\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "RLHFless\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u7684\u540c\u6b65RLHF\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u914d\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \\emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \\textsc{Taesar}, a \\emph{data-centric} framework for \\textbf{t}arget-\\textbf{a}lign\\textbf{e}d \\textbf{s}equenti\\textbf{a}l \\textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures.

Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86HealthBench\u533b\u7597AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u533b\u751f\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b081.8%\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u662f\u75c5\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5206\u6b67\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u533b\u7597AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u533b\u751f\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9HealthBench\u533b\u7597AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u533b\u751f\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u75c5\u4f8b\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u5bf9\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5b8c\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca3.6-6.9%\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u8eab\u4efd\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca2.4%\uff0c81.8%\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u6b8b\u4f59\u53d8\u5f02\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5206\u6b67\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u5206\u6b67\u51e0\u7387\u589e\u52a02.55\u500d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u7597AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u586b\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMA-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u7684AMA-Agent\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5305\u542b\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMA-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684QA\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684QA\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faAMA-Agent\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728AMA-Bench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff1bAMA-Agent\u5728AMA-Bench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523057.22%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534711.16%\u3002", "conclusion": "AMA-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cAMA-Agent\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them.

However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexMS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8d28\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8c31\u56fe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u8c31\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u57fa\u51c6\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efaFlexMS\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u878d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "FlexMS\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc6\u522b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8c31\u56fe\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexMS\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d28\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models.

Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates \"llbox\" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score.

Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner.

Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features.

Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance.

This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus.

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol.

To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought.

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9690\u5199\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49V\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u9690\u5199\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u59cb\u5c55\u73b0\u9690\u5199\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u8ba9\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9003\u907f\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u5199\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u975e\u9690\u5199\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728LLM\u9690\u5199\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9690\u5199\u89c2\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u89c1\u89e3\u662f\u9690\u5199\u5728\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4e0d\u80fd\u89e3\u7801\u9690\u85cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49V\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u9690\u5199\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u5199\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5199\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u9690\u5199\u5dee\u8ddd\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5199\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SC-ARENA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u62bd\u8c61\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u7528\u8fd8\u662f\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f7f\u7528\u8131\u8282\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSC-ARENA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u62bd\u8c61\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u4e94\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u672c\u4f53\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5236\u6216\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2\uff09\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-ARENA\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a \"translator\" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7a0e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\"\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\"\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u8005-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7a0e\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u8005-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5176\u5747\u8861\u5bf9\u5e94\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7a0e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7a0e\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ODEBRAIN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u8111\u7535\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8c31\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86EEG\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u8111\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u590d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349EEG\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faODEBRAIN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8c31\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3) \u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u4e0a\u590d\u6742\u8111\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cODEBRAIN\u5728EEG\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ODEBRAIN\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u8111\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349EEG\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a \"resampling\" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result.

This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u79d1\u5b66\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u7528\u9014\u98ce\u9669\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709LLM\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6709\u5145\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6700\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u8fbe13\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "LLM\u8bbf\u95ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u6709LLM\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662f\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76844.16\u500d\uff0895% CI [2.63, 6.87]\uff09\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709LLM\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u4f46\u72ec\u7acbLLMs\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u65b0\u624b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7528\u6237\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LLM\u6f5c\u529b\u300289.6%\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u83b7\u53d6\u53cc\u91cd\u7528\u9014\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u624b\u5728\u539f\u672c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u4eff\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u548c\u7ecf\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u8d44\u5206\u6790\u660e\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u80a1\u7968\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u8868\u3001\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u5728\u6cc4\u6f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u56de\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u80a1\u7968\u6307\u6570\u7684\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u6613\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}
