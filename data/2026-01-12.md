TL;DR: NAIAD是一个基于大语言模型和外部工具的智能助手，为内陆水体监测提供端到端解决方案，通过单提示界面将自然语言查询转化为可操作的洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内陆水体监测对保护公共健康和生态系统至关重要，但现有方法通常孤立地处理蓝藻、叶绿素等子问题，缺乏整体解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成、LLM推理、外部工具编排、计算图执行和智能体反思等技术，整合天气数据、Sentinel-2影像、遥感指数计算、叶绿素-a估算和CyFi等平台。

Result: 在专门基准测试中，正确性和相关性分别达到77%和85%以上，初步结果显示对不同查询类型具有强适应性和鲁棒性。消融研究表明Gemma 3 (27B)和Qwen 2.5 (14B)在计算效率和推理性能方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: NAIAD为内陆水体监测提供了一个全面的智能助手解决方案，能够有效整合多种数据源和分析工具，为专家和非专家用户提供有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在增材制造中受到知识表示碎片化和稀疏数据条件下外推不可靠的限制，需要更可靠的知识提取和外推建模方法。

Method: 开发了本体论引导的框架，通过形式化本体编码方程、变量、假设及其语义关系，将非结构化文献转化为机器可解释表示。使用知识图谱子图条件化的大语言模型方程生成，确保物理意义的功能形式，并引入置信感知的外推评估方法。

Result: 本体论引导的提取显著提高了提取知识的结构一致性和定量可靠性，子图条件化的方程生成相比无引导的大语言模型输出产生了更稳定和物理一致的外推结果。

Conclusion: 建立了一个统一流程，用于本体驱动的知识表示、以方程为中心的推理和基于置信度的外推评估，展示了知识图谱增强的大语言模型作为增材制造中外推建模可靠工具的潜力。

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出Hyper-Enz模型，通过知识图谱嵌入和超图变换器预测酶-底物相互作用，相比传统方法在酶检索准确率上提升88%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 酶-底物相互作用预测是生物化学和代谢工程的基础问题。现有方法依赖专家标注的酶-底物对数据库，但这些数据库稀疏且维护成本高，缺乏足够的训练数据限制了传统模型的泛化能力。化学反应方程式数据更容易获取且更丰富，但多化合物与同一酶的相互作用形成了复杂的关系模式，传统模型难以捕捉。

Method: 1. 将化学反应方程式表示为(底物，酶，产物)三元组的知识图谱；2. 提出Hyper-Enz模型，结合超图变换器和知识图谱嵌入模型来学习涉及多个底物和产物的超边表示；3. 引入多专家范式，利用模型和化学反应方程式共同指导酶-底物相互作用学习。

Result: 实验结果显示显著改进：酶检索平均准确率相对提升88%，配对级预测提升30%，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将化学反应表示为知识图谱三元组，并利用超图变换器和知识图谱嵌入模型，能够有效预测酶-底物相互作用，解决了传统方法因数据稀疏导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

### [4] [The Persona Paradox: Medical Personas as Behavioral Priors in Clinical Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05376)
*Tassallah Abdullahi,Shrestha Ghosh,Hamish S Fraser,Daniel León Tramontini,Adeel Abbasi,Ghada Bourjeily,Carsten Eickhoff,Ritambhara Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现医疗角色设定对大型语言模型的临床决策影响复杂且非单调：在重症监护任务中提升性能，但在初级护理中反而降低性能，交互风格的影响高度依赖模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色设定通常被视为大型语言模型的行为先验，被认为能提升专业性和安全性，但其对高风险临床决策的具体影响尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 系统评估基于角色的控制对临床LLMs的影响，考察专业角色（急诊医生、护士等）和交互风格（大胆vs谨慎）在不同模型和医疗任务中的表现，使用多维评估方法衡量任务准确性、校准度和安全相关风险行为。

Result: 发现系统性、上下文依赖且非单调的影响：医疗角色在重症监护任务中提升性能（准确性和校准度提升约20%），但在初级护理环境中反而降低性能；交互风格调节风险倾向和敏感性，但高度依赖模型；人类临床医生对安全合规性有中等一致性，但对推理质量信心很低。

Conclusion: 角色设定作为行为先验引入的是上下文依赖的权衡，而非安全或专业性的保证，揭示了角色设定的复杂性和潜在风险。

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

### [5] [On the Effect of Cheating in Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05386)
*Daniel Keren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估在国际象棋比赛中有限次作弊（使用软件建议）可能带来的表现提升，而非检测作弊


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际象棋中使用强大软件作弊已成为严重问题，甚至影响到最高水平比赛。以往研究主要关注作弊检测，而本研究旨在量化有限次作弊可能带来的实际表现提升

Method: 开发算法并在常用国际象棋引擎上进行测试，评估在比赛中有限次数使用软件建议时的表现增益

Result: 通过算法测试量化了有限次作弊对棋手表现的具体提升效果（具体数值未在摘要中给出）

Conclusion: 研究目的不是协助作弊者，而是测量作弊效果，这对于遏制和检测作弊至关重要

Abstract: Cheating in chess, by using advice from powerful software, has become a major problem, reaching the highest levels. As opposed to the large majority of previous work, which concerned {\em detection} of cheating, here we try to evaluate the possible gain in performance, obtained by cheating a limited number of times during a game. Algorithms are developed and tested on a commonly used chess engine (i.e software).\footnote{Needless to say, the goal of this work is not to assist cheaters, but to measure the effectiveness of cheating -- which is crucial as part of the effort to contain and detect it.}

### [6] [ART: Adaptive Reasoning Trees for Explainable Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05455)
*Sahil Wadhwa,Himanshu Kumar,Guanqun Yang,Abbaas Alif Mohamed Nishar,Pranab Mohanty,Swapnil Shinde,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ART（自适应推理树）是一种用于声明验证的分层方法，通过构建支持/攻击论点的树状结构，使用LLM作为裁判进行成对比较，实现透明、可争议的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂决策中具有强大潜力，但其不透明性阻碍了在高风险环境中的应用。现有方法缺乏忠实解释和错误纠正机制，影响了可信度。

Method: ART采用分层树状结构：从根声明开始，分支为支持和攻击的子论点。通过LLM裁判对子论点进行成对锦标赛式比较，自底向上确定论点强度，最终得出透明、可争议的裁决。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实证验证表明，ART的结构化推理优于强基线方法，为可解释的声明验证设立了新基准，提高了可靠性并确保决策步骤的清晰性。

Conclusion: ART通过分层推理树结构解决了LLM在声明验证中的透明度和可争议性问题，提供了一种比Chain-of-Thought等方法更可靠、更清晰的可解释决策框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

### [7] [MMUEChange: A Generalized LLM Agent Framework for Intelligent Multi-Modal Urban Environment Change Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05483)
*Zixuan Xiao,Jun Ma,Siwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMUEChange是一个多模态智能体框架，通过模块化工具包和模态控制器整合异构城市数据，实现复杂城市变化场景的鲁棒分析，相比最佳基线任务成功率提升46.7%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市环境变化分析方法（特别是遥感变化检测）通常依赖僵化的单模态分析，无法有效处理复杂的城市变化场景，需要更灵活的多模态整合方法

Method: 提出MMUEChange多模态智能体框架，包含模块化工具包和核心模块模态控制器，实现跨模态和模态内对齐，灵活整合异构城市数据

Result: 相比最佳基线，任务成功率提升46.7%，有效缓解幻觉问题；案例研究包括：纽约小型社区公园转变、香港跨区域水污染扩散、深圳露天垃圾场减少与夜间经济活动关联分析

Conclusion: MMUEChange框架能够支持具有现实政策意义的复杂城市变化分析任务，为可持续城市发展提供有效工具

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

### [8] [The Evaluation Gap in Medicine, AI and LLMs: Navigating Elusive Ground Truth & Uncertainty via a Probabilistic Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05500)
*Aparna Elangovan,Lei Xu,Mahsa Elyasi,Ismail Akdulum,Mehmet Aksakal,Enes Gurun,Brian Hur,Saab Mansour,Ravid Shwartz Ziv,Karin Verspoor,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出概率评估范式，强调医学AI基准测试中必须考虑专家标注的不确定性，否则可能错误评估系统能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统（特别是LLM和视觉模型）的基准测试通常忽略专家标注答案中的不确定性，这在医学领域尤其成问题，因为医学中不确定性普遍存在。忽略这种不确定性可能导致误导性结论，使非专家系统看起来与专家表现相似。

Method: 引入概率评估范式，提出期望准确率和期望F1分数来估计在给定标注答案变异性的情况下专家或系统能达到的分数。建议根据标注答案的概率（通常通过专家一致率衡量）对结果进行分层评估。

Result: 研究表明，在标注答案高度确定的情况下，专家才能获得高分；而在标注答案变异大的数据集中，随机标注者与专家之间可能几乎没有差异。分层评估使高确定性区间的性能比较更加可靠。

Conclusion: 评估AI系统能力时应考虑标注不确定性，当总体性能低于80%阈值时，分层评估变得至关重要。通过按标注确定性分层，可以减轻不确定性的混淆效应，获得更可靠的性能比较。

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在许多科学和工程任务中已超越人类，但其内部表示往往不透明。作者认为需要可解释AI来理解AI的内部工作机制，从而从AI模型中学习知识。

Method: 将可解释人工智能（XAI）与因果推理相结合，利用基础模型和可解释性方法提取因果机制，指导稳健的设计和控制。

Result: 展示了这种组合方法在科学发现、优化和认证三个领域的应用潜力，能够提取因果机制、指导稳健设计、支持高风险应用中的信任和问责。

Conclusion: XAI可以作为科学和工程中人机协作的统一框架，但需要解决解释的忠实性、泛化性和可用性等挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过定性评估火灾疏散场景，识别LLM决策中的关键失败案例，设计了7个定量评估任务，发现当前LLM在安全关键系统中存在严重漏洞，99%准确率在机器人领域仍意味着不可接受的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）融入机器人决策，物理风险维度增加，单个错误指令可能直接危及人类安全。迫切需要系统评估LLM在即使微小错误也会造成灾难性后果的场景中的表现。

Method: 通过火灾疏散场景的定性评估识别关键失败案例，设计7个定量评估任务：完整信息任务（使用ASCII地图减少解释歧义）、不完整信息任务（需要推断缺失上下文）、安全导向空间推理任务（使用自然语言评估生命威胁情境下的安全决策）。对多种LLM和视觉语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 结果揭示严重漏洞：多个模型在ASCII导航中达到0%成功率；在模拟消防演习中，模型指示机器人向危险区域而非紧急出口移动。分析显示1%失败率如何升级为灾难性后果。

Conclusion: 当前LLM尚未准备好直接部署到安全关键系统中。99%准确率在机器人领域具有误导性，意味着每百次执行中可能有一次导致灾难性伤害。即使最先进模型也无法保证安全，绝对依赖它们会带来不可接受的风险。

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够有效挖掘文本交易数据中嵌入的多样信任和风险信号，为电子商务欺诈检测提供了新的有效途径，弥补了传统机器学习局限与LLMs未开发潜力之间的差距。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱补全方法在处理新兴实体时效果不佳，现有归纳KGC方法虽然能处理新兴实体和关系，但仍面临噪声结构信息干扰和难以捕捉推理路径中长距离依赖的挑战。

Method: 提出CPSR框架，包含查询相关掩码模块（自适应掩码噪声结构信息并保留与目标相关的关键信息）和全局语义评分模块（评估推理路径中节点的个体贡献和集体影响）。

Result: 实验结果表明CPSR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CPSR框架通过同时捕捉知识图谱的结构和语义信息，有效提升了归纳知识图谱补全任务的效果。

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 随着生成模型的普及，需要细粒度控制生成过程，但现有控制方法（从提示到微调）未能回答一个基本问题：这些模型是否真正可控？作者旨在提供一个理论框架来正式回答这个问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为控制过程，提出一种新颖算法来估计对话设置中模型的可控集。该方法提供形式化保证，估计误差作为样本复杂度的函数，推导出分布无关的PAC边界，仅假设输出有界，适用于任何黑盒非线性控制系统（即任何生成模型）。

Result: 在控制对话过程的不同任务上进行了实证验证，包括语言模型和文本到图像生成。结果显示模型可控性出人意料地脆弱，高度依赖实验设置。

Conclusion: 强调需要进行严格的可控性分析，将重点从简单地尝试控制转向首先理解其基本限制。模型可控性比预期更脆弱，需要更深入的理论理解。

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

TL;DR: HAG是一个分层智能体生成框架，通过两阶段决策过程解决基于智能体建模中的高保真初始化问题，实现主题自适应、宏观分布对齐和微观一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于智能体建模需要高保真智能体初始化以建立可信模型。现有方法存在两大问题：基于静态数据检索的方法无法适应未见主题；基于大语言模型生成的方法缺乏宏观分布意识，导致微观个体属性与现实不一致。

Method: 提出HAG分层智能体生成框架，将群体生成形式化为两阶段决策过程：1) 使用世界知识模型推断分层条件概率构建主题自适应树，实现宏观分布对齐；2) 基于真实世界数据进行实例化和智能体增强，确保微观一致性。

Result: 实验表明HAG显著优于代表性基线方法，平均减少群体对齐误差37.7%，提升社会学一致性18.8%。建立了多领域基准和全面的PACE评估框架。

Conclusion: HAG框架有效解决了智能体初始化中的主题适应性和分布一致性问题，为基于智能体建模提供了高质量的群体生成方法。

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

TL;DR: 论文识别了大型推理模型中的"循环推理"失败模式，开发了LoopBench数据集进行分析，揭示了循环机制，并提出使用CUSUM算法进行早期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时缩放技术取得了成功，但大型推理模型经常遇到重复循环，导致计算浪费和推理失败。作者识别了一种独特的失败模式——循环推理，与传统模型退化不同，这种现象表现为自我强化的陷阱，其中生成的内容作为自身重复的逻辑前提。

Method: 1. 引入LoopBench数据集，捕捉两种循环类型：数值循环和语句循环；2. 从机制上描述循环推理为状态崩溃，具有明显边界；3. 揭示推理僵局触发循环开始，随后由自我强化的V形注意力机制驱动；4. 使用累积和(CUSUM)算法捕捉这些前兆进行早期循环预测。

Result: 实验验证了CUSUM算法在不同大型推理模型中的准确性，并阐明了长链推理的稳定性。该方法能够有效预测循环推理现象。

Conclusion: 论文系统分析了大型推理模型中的循环推理现象，揭示了其机制，并提出了有效的早期预测方法，为提高推理模型的稳定性和效率提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个逻辑参数化的神经符号自然语言推理框架，将底层逻辑作为可控制组件而非固定形式系统，通过LogiKEy方法嵌入多种经典和非经典逻辑，在规范推理领域比较逻辑外部与内部方法，证明逻辑内部策略能提升性能并生成更高效的混合证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合大语言模型和定理证明器的可验证自然语言推理方法依赖固定的逻辑形式系统，这限制了系统的鲁棒性和适应性。需要一种更灵活的方法来处理不同领域的推理需求。

Method: 提出逻辑参数化框架，使用LogiKEy方法将多种经典和非经典逻辑嵌入高阶逻辑中，系统比较推理质量、解释细化和证明行为。特别关注规范推理，比较逻辑外部方法（通过公理编码规范要求）和逻辑内部方法（规范模式从逻辑内置结构中产生）。

Result: 实验表明逻辑内部策略能持续提升性能并为自然语言推理生成更高效的混合证明。逻辑的有效性具有领域依赖性：一阶逻辑在常识推理中表现更好，而道义逻辑和模态逻辑在伦理领域表现更优。

Conclusion: 将逻辑作为神经符号架构中的一等参数化元素，能够实现更鲁棒、模块化和适应性强的推理系统，逻辑的选择应根据具体领域需求而定。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

TL;DR: PII-VisBench基准测试评估视觉语言模型在个人身份信息泄露方面的安全性，发现模型对高在线可见度主体的PII泄露更严重，且存在模型家族异质性和PII类型差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM隐私评估主要将隐私视为静态提取任务，忽略了主体在线存在（数据可用量）对隐私对齐的影响。需要评估VLM在不同在线可见度下的PII泄露风险。

Method: 提出PII-VisBench基准，包含4000个独特探针，将200个主体按在线信息程度分为高、中、低、零四个可见度类别。评估18个开源VLM（0.3B-32B），使用拒绝率和条件PII泄露率两个关键指标。

Result: 模型呈现一致模式：随着主体可见度降低，拒绝率增加，PII泄露率减少（从高可见度的9.10%降至低可见度的5.34%）。模型更可能泄露高可见度主体的PII，存在显著的模型家族异质性和PII类型差异。改述和越狱式提示暴露了攻击和模型相关的失败。

Conclusion: 需要基于可见度的安全性评估和训练干预，以解决VLM在不同在线存在程度下的PII泄露风险差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体辩论框架存在未引导初始化问题，导致智能体采用相同推理路径并犯相同错误，使得辩论效果受限，最终结果往往退化为简单多数投票。

Method: 提出DynaDebate框架，包含三个核心机制：1) 动态路径生成与分配，使用专门的路径生成智能体生成多样化且有逻辑的解决方案路径；2) 过程中心辩论，从表面结果投票转向逐步逻辑批判以确保过程正确性；3) 触发式验证智能体，在出现分歧时激活并使用外部工具客观解决僵局。

Result: 大量实验表明，DynaDebate在各种基准测试中实现了优越性能，超越了现有的最先进多智能体辩论方法。

Conclusion: DynaDebate通过引入动态路径生成、过程中心辩论和触发式验证机制，有效解决了传统多智能体辩论框架的局限性，显著提升了多智能体系统的推理和协作能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

TL;DR: StackPlanner是一个具有显式内存控制的分层多智能体框架，通过解耦高层协调与子任务执行，并利用结构化经验记忆和强化学习来重用协调经验，解决了多智能体系统中内存效率低下和协调经验无法重用的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的集中式多智能体系统在处理复杂知识密集型任务时表现出潜力，但中央智能体由于缺乏内存管理，导致上下文膨胀、错误累积和跨任务泛化能力差，无法实现稳定的长时程协作。

Method: 提出StackPlanner分层多智能体框架，包含两个核心机制：1）通过主动任务级内存控制解耦高层协调与子任务执行；2）通过结构化经验记忆和强化学习来检索和利用可重用的协调经验。

Result: 在多个深度搜索和智能体系统基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能够实现可靠的长时程多智能体协作，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: StackPlanner通过显式内存控制和协调经验重用，解决了集中式多智能体系统中的内存效率低下和长时程协作不稳定问题，为复杂知识密集型任务提供了有效的多智能体协作框架。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 现有实时策略游戏环境要么计算需求高，要么缺乏文本观察支持，限制了其用于大语言模型评估。需要一种既能保留RTS游戏评估优势，又具有低计算需求和多模态观察空间的环境。

Method: 基于塔防游戏子类型构建TowerMind环境，包含像素、文本和结构化游戏状态三种观察表示，支持模型幻觉评估和高定制性。设计了五个基准关卡，在不同多模态输入设置下评估多个大语言模型。

Result: 实验显示大语言模型与人类专家在能力和幻觉维度存在明显性能差距，揭示了LLM的关键局限性：规划验证不足、决策缺乏多终局性、行动使用效率低。同时评估了Ape-X DQN和PPO两种经典强化学习算法。

Conclusion: TowerMind通过轻量级多模态设计补充了现有RTS游戏环境，为AI智能体领域引入了新的基准测试平台，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub(https://github.com/tb6147877/TowerMind).

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个开放词汇3D指令歧义检测任务，构建了包含700多个3D场景和22k指令的大规模基准Ambi3D，发现现有3D大语言模型难以可靠检测指令歧义，并提出了两阶段框架AmbiVer来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，语言歧义可能带来严重后果，但现有具身AI研究大多忽视这一问题，假设指令清晰且专注于执行而非确认。为填补这一安全空白，需要开发能够检测3D环境中指令歧义的系统。

Method: 提出了AmbiVer两阶段框架：第一阶段从多个视角收集显式视觉证据，第二阶段使用这些证据指导视觉语言模型判断指令歧义。同时构建了大规模基准数据集Ambi3D用于评估。

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的3D大语言模型在检测指令歧义方面表现不佳，而提出的AmbiVer框架在该任务上表现出有效性，为更安全可靠的具身AI铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 该研究首次定义了开放词汇3D指令歧义检测任务，揭示了现有模型的局限性，提出的AmbiVer框架为解决这一关键安全问题提供了有效方法，推动了更安全可信的具身AI发展。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.
